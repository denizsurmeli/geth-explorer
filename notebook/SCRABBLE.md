## Taking a more serious approach

- **Blockchains**:
  - There are blocks
  - There are transactions
  - There are addresses
  - There are different networks
- **Others**
  - There should be tools that help us to do common things(math,strings,filemanip etc.)
  - Since the providers do not provide a standard node message/response structure,we should find a way to regulate them in the output. 
  - Outputs can be regulated, since blockchains are regulated.
- Take a more serious approach, but remember to have fun also. Practically you know nothing about `go` and inner workings of `geth`, `network programming` etc. Just learn along the way.
